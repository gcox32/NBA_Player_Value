### Order of Execution

> In order to recreate the visualizations seen here, it's important that one re-runs the code in the correct order.
> The 3 webscraping notebooks pull the majority of our data and take approximately 4 minutes 15 seconds each to run.
> Critically, the player-level data-wrangling must be performed after the webscraping and before the EDA.
> My efforts then brought me to the NBA_functions notebook, but those function have been saved as a .py file for use in the EDA, so there is no need to run that code.
